# StumpWM Run Control

I found out about a window manager that runs entirely on Common Lisp.
This includes sending it commands through Swank and Slime, meaning
it's configurable while it's currently running.  On top of that it's
configured in Common Lisp, a much more expressive language than XML
files or i3's config.  Looking forward to seeing what's possible with
a programmable window manager.
